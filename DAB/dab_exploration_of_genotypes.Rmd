HiSEQ run sent to Fasteris, CH on 17.7.2017.
```{r}
xy1 <- fread("./DAB/data/dab_hiseq1_genotypes.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
            colClasses = list(character = c(1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12),
                              numeric = c(2, 3, 6)))
```

How many different samples do we find?
```{r}
length(unique(xy1[, Sample_Name]))
```

Are there any blanks?
```{r}
xy1[grepl("blank", Sample_Name), ]
```
It would appear they've been eliminated from the run.

How many repeats per sample do we detect?
```{r}
ggplot(xy1[, j = .N, by = .(Sample_Name, Marker)], aes(x = N)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 35)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Marker)
```

Histogram of lengths of alleles give loci.
```{r}
ggplot(xy1[, j = length, by = .(Marker)], aes(x = length)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ Marker)
```
